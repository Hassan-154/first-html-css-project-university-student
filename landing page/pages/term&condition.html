    <p>
      THE COMPANYMAYPROVIDELINKSANDPOINTERSTOINTERNETWEBSITES

    <h5 style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 22px; padding-bottom: 4px; margin-top: 20px;"> YOURRESPONSIBILITY TO THE COMPANY</h5>
    <p>
      You are responsible and liable to the Company and its affiliated companies, officers, directors,
      employees, agents, licensors, and suppliers in respect of all losses, expenses, damages, and
      costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, resulting from any violation by you of this
      Agreement. The Company reserves the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of
      any matter that you are responsible and liable for under this paragraph.
     
    </p>

    <h5 style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 22px; padding-bottom: 4px; margin-top: 20px;">LITIGATION ISSUES(California)</h5>
    <p>
      This Agreement is entered into in the State of California and shall be governed by, and
      construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, exclusive of its choice of law
      rules. The End User License Agreement contains a binding individual arbitration and class
      action waiver provision that affects your rights with respect to any ‘Dispute’ between you and the
      Company and requires you and the Company to resolve Disputes in binding, individual
      arbitration, and not in court. You have a right to opt out of the Binding Individual Arbitration
      section as explained in the EULA. Please read it carefully before installing or using any
      Company software or services. The Binding Individual Arbitration section shall not apply to the
      extent prohibited by the laws of your country of residence. For any disputes not subject to
      binding individual arbitration, you and the Company agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
      of the state and federal courts in Alameda County, California, and to waive any jurisdictional,
      venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts (but without affecting either party’s rights
      to remove a case to federal court if permissible). This paragraph will be interpreted as broadly
      as applicable law permits. For example, if you are a resident of a European Union member
      state, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of consumer protection law in the member
      state in which you are resident, and you can bring legal proceedings in relation to this
      Agreement in the courts of the member state in which you are resident. The Company has the
      right to prosecute civil claims against you for any violation of its End User License Agreement,
      the Terms of Service, the Privacy Policy, or any other governing terms and conditions related to
      its software and services, whether for breach of contract, violation of common law rights, or
      violation of any applicable state or federal statute. Any violation by you of such governing terms
      shall constitute an affirmative defense (whether characterized as arising at law or in equity)
      against any claim you might assert against the Company in connection with the Online Services.
    </p>

      MILLENNIUM COPYRIGHT ACT</h5>
    <p>
      The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") provides a mechanism for notifying service
      providers of claims of unauthorized use of copyrighted materials. Under the DMCA, a claim
      must be sent to the service provider’s designated agent. If you believe in good faith that the
      Company should be notified of a possible online copyright infringement involving any Online
      Service, please notify the Company’s designated agent: E-mail: <a href="mailto:sjadams@adamslaw.biz">sjadams@adamslaw.biz</a>
      Please be aware that, in order to be effective, your notice of claim must comply with the detailed
      requirements set forth in the DMCA. You are encouraged to review them (see 17 U.S.C. Sec.
      512(c)(3)) before sending your notice of claim. To meet the notice requirements under the
      DMCA, the notification must be a written communication that includes the following: (1) A
      physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an
      exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (2) Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to
      have been infringed, or if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a
      single notification, a representative list of such works at that site; (3) Identification of the material
      that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed
      or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate
      the material; (4) Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party,
      such as an address, telephone number and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the
      complaining party may be contacted; (5) A statement that the complaining party has a
      good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the
      copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (6) A statement that the information in the notification
      is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on
      behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
